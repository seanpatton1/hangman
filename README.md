# Hangman

![Hangman responsive image]()

I have developed a hangman game in Python that is played in the terminal. In this game, you compete against the computer, and it offers three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. 

The objective is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. The computer randomly selects a word, and you guess letters one by one. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position(s) in the word, while incorrect guesses add to the hangman diagram. 

You win by successfully guessing all letters in the word before the hangman diagram is fully drawn, and you lose if you fail to guess the word before the hangman diagram is completed. 

Visit the deployed game [here]().
